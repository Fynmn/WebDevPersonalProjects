                <p class="article">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them. </p>
                <p class="article">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing
                    it with additional objects; for example: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="article">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                        to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li class="article">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java
                </header>
                <p class="article">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                    naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. </p>
                <p class="article">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object
                    model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods. </p>
                <p class="article">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
                    interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed. </p>

                <p class="article">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>
                <p class="article">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and
                    the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>
                <p class="article">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. </p>

                    Data Types
                </header>
                <p class="article">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="article">Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="article">Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li class="article">null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
                        <li class="article">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li class="article">Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li class="article">String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li class="article">Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="article">and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers
                    for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform. </p>
